# Stock-analysis VBA
Using VBA helped me find a more significant understanding of data and set automated task to the current project for success. 
## Overview of Project 
In this module, we were able to help my good friend Steve with creating an analysis for his parents that are passionate about green energy. They decided to invest in a solar panel company named DAQO New Energy Corp. Steve has asked me to help him analyze DQ's stock trades and other similar green energy companies.
### Purpose
Analyzing the green stock data and using the findings and critical factors to help Steve's parents make an informed investment decision.  
## Results
We analyzed the green stock data to help Steve's parents to make a data-driven decision using facts, metrics, and the data. Our main objective was to help Steve have an analysis that can help be strategic and tactical in helping his parent with the investment based on data, not feelings. I used VBA to automate various tasks to perform the analysis more efficiently. We created an analysis for DQ and All stocks.  We use VBA to created subroutines to display headers row, set initial volume to zero, creating loops to find numbers, increasing total volume by the value in the current row, and if statements to help analyze the data. Also, we created an input box to help Steve select the year he would like to run the analysis and button to make it easier for him and his parents. We also refactor the code to make the study run more efficiently. We found that DQ's return in 2017 was 199.4%, with a Volume of 35,796,200, and in 2018 DQ had a Total Daily Volume of 107,873,900 and a return of -62.6%. We were also able to compare DQ with other stocks. We include 2017 vs. 2018 comparison in the resource folder. (VS Image add)![2017 vs. 2018 Conpariszon Analisis](./resources/image.png) The 2017 refactor code ran in 0.89 vs. 2017 Original Code ran in 0.96. The refactor code for 2018 ran at 0.86 vs. the original code ran in 0.92.

## Summary 
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
 Refactoring is the process of changing the structure of existing code without changing the external behavior of that code. It is intended to make the code easier to understand. I found that is time consuming. 
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
I found that the pros are that it is easier to read and understand, and the cons are that it is harder to maintain.
